# Project3Final
This project allows one to search through an emulated grocery store, output all items, and print a histogram representation of items.

I feel that I did very well using OOP concepts and maps to solve this assignment.

I think I could have used try catch and there is likely a way to better conatain logic so main does less work.

I found working with maps to be the confusing, since it is a c++ construct I had no seen until this week, I defenitely will continue to make use of documentation and forums like stack overflow.

I think the OOP will be incredibly transferable, I have a long way to go in learning many OOP concepts, but they are powerful and using them will have carryover to other languages and projects. 

I made this program maintainable by making use of encapsualation with objects and methods. I also made it more readable by including comments and making sure it was well formatted (I use a formatter).
